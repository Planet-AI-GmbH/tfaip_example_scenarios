# Image Classification Scenario

The Image Classification Tutorial maps the corresponding [Tensorflow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) to _tfaip_.
Improvements such as data augmentation and dropout are omitted in this tutorial and can be integrated as an exercise.

## Run
To run the training of this scenario execute (in the cloned dir)
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD  # required so that the scenario is detected

# Training
tfaip-train tfaipscenarios.imageclassification --trainer.output_dir ic_model
tfaip-train tfaipscenarios.imageclassification --trainer.output_dir ic_model --device.gpus 0  # to run training on the first GPU, if available
tfaip-train tfaipscenarios.imageclassification --model.conv_filters 30 50 60 --model.dense 200 200 --trainer.output_dir ic_model --device.gpus 0  # try a different (larger) model

# TensorBoard can be used to view the training process
tensorboard --logdir .
# Open http://localhost:6006

# Prediction
tfaip-predict --export_dir ic_model/best --data.image_files tfaipscenarios/imageclassification/examples/592px-Red_sunflower.jpg 
# Possible Output >>> This image most likely belongs to sunflowers with a 0.83 percent confidence.
